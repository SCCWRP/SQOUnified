\title{Get the Statistical Summary for Tox Results Data}
\usage{
tox.summary(toxresults)
}
\arguments{
\item{toxresults}{a dataframe with the following columns: stationid, toxbatch, species, sampletypecode
   matrix, labrep, result. This data must also include the control samples
   (stationcode 0000, sampletypecode CNEG etc)

   The input dataframe is structured as follows

   \strong{\code{toxresults}} -  a dataframe that contains the toxicity results

   \strong{\code{stationid}} - an alpha-numeric identifier of the location;

   \strong{\code{toxbatch}} - the toxbatch id - used to join with the control sample

   \strong{\code{species}} - The Genus and species of the animale that was tested

   \strong{\code{sampletypecode}} - The sampletype used Grab, CNEG etc. Control samples must be included

   \strong{\code{matrix}} - Whole Sediment, Sediment Water Interface, etc. Probably useless to include.
                   I Just have it to make sure they dont put Reference Toxicant

   \strong{\code{labrep}} - There should be 5 per station, species pair

   \strong{\code{result}} - the percentage that survived the test, or had normal development}
}
\description{
This function will calculate the tox summary,

given an argument which is a dataframe of tox results data
