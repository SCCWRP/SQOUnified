#' @details
#'   The BRI is the abundance weighted pollution tolerance score of the organisms present in a benthic sample. The higher
#'   the BRI score, the more degraded the benthic community represented by the sample.
#'
#'   Two types of data are needed to calculate the BRI:
#'
#'   (1) the abundance of each species and
#'   (2) its pollution tolerance score, P.
#'
#'   The P values are available for most species present in the assemblage. Only species for which P values are avialable
#'   are used in the BRI calculations. P values showld be obtained for the appropriate habitat and from the most
#'   up-to-date list available.
#'
#'   The first step in the BRI calculation is to compute the 4th root of the abundance of each taxon in the sample for
#'   which P values are available. The next step is to multiply the 4th root abundance value by the P value, for each
#'   taxon.
#'
#'   Next, separately sum all of the 4th roots of the abundances and all of the products of the 4th roots of abundance
#'   and P values. Taxa that lack P values are not included in either sum. The next step is to calculate the BRI score
#'   as:
#'
#'   \deqn{ \frac{\sum \left(\sqrt[p]{\textrm{Abundance}} \right) \times P}{\sum \sqrt[p]{\textrm{Abundance}}} }
#'
#'   The last step is to compare the BRI score to the BRI threshold values in Table 5 to determine the BRI category and
#'   category score.

#' @param BenthicData a data frame with the following headings
#'
#'    \strong{\code{StationID}} - an alpha-numeric identifier of the location;
#'
#'    \strong{\code{Replicate}} - a numeric identifying the replicate number of samples taken at the location;
#'
#'    \strong{\code{SampleDate}} - the date of sample collection;
#'
#'    \strong{\code{Latitude}} - latitude in decimal degrees;
#'
#'    \strong{\code{Longitude}} - longitude in decimal degrees.
#'    Make sure there is a negative sign for the Western coordinates;
#'
#'    \strong{\code{Species}} - name of the fauna, ideally in SCAMIT ed12 format, do not use sp. or spp.,
#'        use sp only or just the Genus. If no animals were present in the sample use
#'        NoOrganismsPresent with 0 abundance;
