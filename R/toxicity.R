#---- tox summary ----
#' Get the Statistical Summary for Tox Results Data
#'
#' @description
#' This function will calculate the tox summary,
#'
#' given an argument which is a dataframe of tox results data
#'
#' @param toxresults a dataframe with the following columns: stationid, toxbatch, species, sampletypecode
#'    matrix, labrep, result. This data must also include the control samples
#'    (stationcode 0000, sampletypecode CNEG etc)
#'
#'    The input dataframe is structured as follows
#'
#'    \strong{\code{toxresults}} -  a dataframe that contains the toxicity results
#'
#'    \strong{\code{stationid}} - an alpha-numeric identifier of the location;
#'
#'    \strong{\code{toxbatch}} - the toxbatch id - used to join with the control sample
#'
#'    \strong{\code{species}} - The Genus and species of the animale that was tested
#'
#'    \strong{\code{sampletypecode}} - The sampletype used Grab, CNEG etc. Control samples must be included
#'
#'    \strong{\code{matrix}} - Whole Sediment, Sediment Water Interface, etc. Probably useless to include.
#'                    I Just have it to make sure they dont put Reference Toxicant
#'
#'    \strong{\code{labrep}} - There should be 5 per station, species pair
#'
#'    \strong{\code{result}} - the percentage that survived the test, or had normal development
